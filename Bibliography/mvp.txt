Short and quick spurts of visible work can do a useful job in collecting early feedback from early adopters. This could go a long way in deciding on how we need our product and what business value we can attach to it.

> ii) To know the pulse of a volatile market – Whether our idea is a fresh one or an existing one with a new twist, we can’t be certain about a definite demand for it when it is launched. We are going to face an unpredictable market as user expectations keep changing. It is therefore essential to tap the prospects’ feedback.

We can then build on the feedback we get from actual users. What’s important here is to put our idea out in the market, in a short time, with very less investment. The early market response we get will either pave our way to a successful startup or help save millions.
